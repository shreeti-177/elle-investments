<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Times'>INVESTMENT THESIS:</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>XIN is a Chinese real estate
developer and property manager that is trading at a very depressed valuation,
which is common for Chinese companies of this nature. But we feel that the real
estate projects outside of China (i.e. NYC, UK), the substantial investment by
global private investment firm TPG (3.1% of shares outstanding as of 9/23/19
according to Yahoo Finance), and the 31 consecutive quarters of paying a
dividend significantly de-risk a position in XIN. It may take awhile (if ever)
for the market to give XIN’s stock a fairer valuation, but in the meantime, patience
can be rewarded via the 9%+ dividend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Times'>LIQUIDITY POSITION:</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times'> Fair</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>As of 2Q18 (which ended 6/30/19),
XIN had cash on hand of $1B (includes cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,
and short-term investments). They were profitable in 2018, and for 2019 they have
maintained their guidance of 15-20% net income growth. This implies net income to
common shareholders of about $87M for 2019.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>However, XIN does have a
very large debt load, which stood at $3.6B as of 2Q19. Thus far XIN seems able
to easily access more funding and extend their debt maturities into the future.
The risk here is the questionable terms of the financing decisions that
management is making, which continue to push their weighted average interest
rate up. On April 29, they announced the issuance (offered outside of the US)
of $300M worth of 14.2% senior notes due 2021. The proceeds were used to
partially retire two other batches of senior notes paying interest rates of
8.1% and 9.9%. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>Frankly, the jury is still
out about management’s rationale behind this expensive-looking maneuver. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times;background:yellow'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Times'>COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS:</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times'> Very Good</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>As previously mentioned, XIN
earned very healthy profits in 2018 and expects to grow net income by 15-20%
for 2019, implying net income to common shareholders of about $87M. For 2019,
we calculate earnings of $1.49/ADS (this includes the 1M restricted stock units
(RSUs) that are not included in the diluted share count of 57.4M).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>The absurdly low valuation
(indicated by the forward P/E of 2.8x) is not uncommon for Chinese real estate
companies, given the heightened fear that US investors have towards real estate
valuations in China.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>It’s true that the majority
of their revenue comes from their real estate development projects in</span> <span
style='font-family:Times'>tier-one and tier-two cities in China such as
Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Xi'an, and Suzhou. This makes it difficult
for US investors to verify the stated book value of their assets. However, they
do have a growing list of projects outside of China, most notably in New York
City (the Oosten Project in Brooklyn and the Hudson Garden Project in Manhattan)
and the UK.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>These projects validate
their business operations. The fact that they have paid a quarterly dividend
for 31 consecutive quarters (and counting) speaks towards management’s
willingness to return capital to shareholders—something that many other Chinese
companies are reluctant to do. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>Because of these important
differences, we think XIN is deserving of a more favorable valuation and have
assumed a target forward P/E of 7x to calculate our PT.        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'><span style='font-family:
Times'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>XIN is not without risks.
The questionable financing decisions by management, the slowing Chinese economy,
and the effect of Brexit on the UK’s real estate market need to be considered.
But we feel that this has been punished too severely. The very low valuation is
not indicative of a company that is growing the top and bottom line, has a
growing list of real estate projects in major cities of both the US and Europe,
has the backing of well-known global investor TPG, and has paid a dividend
(currently 9%+) consistently for the past several years. The market may never
assign it a more favorable P/E, which means that our PT may never be reached.
But the consistent dividend makes this worth a position. We think XIN is a buy.</span></p>
