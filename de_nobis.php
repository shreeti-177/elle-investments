        <p id="D2">Elle Investments is a small family office specializing in asset management. The investment fund operated by Elle utilizes both quantitative and value investing strategies to seek out excellent high-return opportunities around the globe, with a particular emphasis on stocks that trade on the US markets. While a good part of our research focuses on small- and mid-cap equities in the biotech space, we are always on the lookout for favorable risk/reward investments across all sectors of the economy. Our trading strategies seek to take advantage of temporary mispricings that arise from overreactions to earnings misses, FDA decisions/clinical trial data readouts, macro news, etc., with the aim of generating returns that are independent of macro market movements.
