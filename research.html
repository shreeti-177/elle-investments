<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4246239-chesapeake-energy-corporation-thesis-playing">=> Chesapeake Energy Corporation: The Thesis Is Playing Out
</a><br>

Investment Thesis: CHK’s 4Q18 results showed demonstrable progress on the two main transformation drivers: increased oil production (as a percentage of total production volume) and increasing adjusted EBITDA (per boe). They will still be FCF negative for 2019, but the market’s reaction indicates that it sees very solid earnings in 2020 and beyond.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4244076-firsthand-technology-value-fund-update">=> Firsthand Technology Value Fund: An Update
            </a><br>

            Investment Thesis: Since our previous article on SVVC was published, one of their top holdings, PHUN, has exhibited extreme volatility, soaring to $300+/share in early February before dropping back down to below $40/share. Management’s updated NAV/share value has barely budged, given that they do not yet value PHUN at market price due to the extreme volatility. We felt that an update was required to demonstrate that even with the collapse of PHUN’s share price, SVVC is still an asymmetric opportunity.

            </a><br>

            Investment Thesis: XIN is a Chinese real estate developer and property manager that is trading at a very depressed valuation, which is common for Chinese companies of this nature. But we feel that the real estate projects outside of China (NYC, UK), the substantial investment by global private investment firm TPG, and the 28 consecutive quarters of paying a dividend significantly de-risk this. It may take awhile for investors to give it a more fair valuation, but in the meantime we will continue to collect the 8% dividend.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4237533-firsthand-technology-value-fund-quasi-arbitrage-opportunity">=> Firsthand Technology Value Fund: A Quasi-Arbitrage Opportunity</a><br>

            Investment Thesis: SVVC is a publicly traded venture capital fund. Just like GSVC, another publicly traded venture capital fund, it has historically traded at a steep discount (50%) to the NAV/share of its combined holdings. Based on some recent IPOs of 3 of its top 5 holdings (one of which has increased in value astronomically), the calculated NAV/share has increased significantly since the last update from management. But the stock now trades at a 70%+ discount to NAV/share, creating a very compelling buying opportunity.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4234308-positive-outlook-chesapeake-energy">=> Positive Outlook For Chesapeake Energy</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: CHK recently announced preliminary 4Q18 results. In addition to meeting/exceeding production expectations, profitability per rig is improving. The merger with WRD continues to offer big upside for both companies, given the very low forward PEs they both exhibit, driven by merger synergies and CHK’s billions in NOLs.

        <p class = "symbol">Symbol: TLRD<br>
            Date Published: January 17, 2019</p>

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4233969-tailored-brands-recent-40-percent-drop-unwarranted-creates-opportunity">=> Tailored Brands: The Recent 40% Drop Is Unwarranted And Creates An Opportunity</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: Comps have come down a bit, but fears that this is the start of a downward trend are unwarranted. TLRD is still very profitable, debt is being paid down, the 6% dividend is safe, and the low forward PE offers a good entry point.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4231528-office-depot-december-sell-unfair">=> Office Depot: The December Sell-Off Was Unfair</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: The December market downturn clipped 30% off the market cap. The last 3 earnings reports have seen guidance either reaffirmed or raised, but the stock has now given back all the previous gains. With bankruptcy off the table, ODP is now focused on integrating CompuCom and continuing its transition into services, aiming to become a one-stop-shop for small and medium-sized businesses to obtain help with marketing, IT, accounting, etc. The safe 4% dividend, $100M share buyback that started January 1, and the low forward PE make this a top pick.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4222560-otonomy-patience-can-well-rewarded">=> Otonomy: Patience Can Well Be Rewarded</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: This is a very long-term investment, as the follow-up phase 3 Otividex trial will not read out until 2020. But the cash situation remains excellent, and the commercial prospects remain unchanged. The drift down from $6/share at the beginning of 2018 presents an excellent entry and accumulation point.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4218175-mcdermott-international-profit-sunk-costs">=> McDermott International: Profit From Sunk Costs!</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: Management’s poor due diligence on the CBI backlog (missing the cost overruns on legacy projects) and the very dilutive financing deal with Goldman Sachs justify shareholder anger. But the 43% drop in stock price is an overreaction, as these are now sunk costs, and the financials going forward look good.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4216895-chesapeake-energy-baby-bathwater">=> Chesapeake Energy: The Baby In The Bathwater</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: Given the expected cost savings from the merger of $1-$1.5B by 2023, the ability of CHK and WRD to manage their debt together is certainly higher than their ability to manage it separately. Because of this, the negative market reaction to the merger announcement is unjustified and creates a buying opportunity.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4209402-iridex-corporation-pretty-safe-penny-stock-ever-thing">=> Iridex Corporation: A Pretty Safe Penny Stock, If There Ever Was Such A Thing</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: IRIX offers much less risk than what is usually found among stocks of such small market cap size. Prior to the drop from the recent public offering (which derisked the balance sheet), two consecutive earnings reports showed very strong growth from their Cyclo G6 laser platform, making it clear that they are on their way to disrupting the global glaucoma treatment market.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4186516-american-superconductor-now">=> American Superconductor: Where To Now?</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: The market was clearly not happy with the court settlement, given that after more than five years of litigation, AMSC was only able to recoup $58M in damages, even though losses in annual revenue stemming from IP theft at the hands of Chinese wind giant Sinovel totaled more than $500M. However, while news regarding the wind segment is pushing down the stock price, the company's other operating segment is set to begin commercialization of a technology that could revamp the electric grid nationwide, allowing neighborhoods that lose power from a storm or terrorist attack to regain it much faster than legacy technology allows.<br>

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4185767-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-akebia-therapeutics-reaction-merger-announcement-justified">=> Keryx Biopharmaceuticals and Akebia Therapeutics: Was The Reaction To The Merger Announcement Justified?</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: The commercial prospects of KERX’s lead drug Auryxia and AKBA’s lead candidate Vadadustat remain unchanged post-merger announcement. At a minimum, the value of the combined company should be equal to the value of each company separately, given the expected $250M in synergies. The downward market reaction seems unjustified, and offers a good entry point.<br>

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4180431-steadymed-merger-good-upside-left">=> SteadyMed: The Merger Is Good, But There Is More Upside Left</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: The recently announced merger with UTHR was a nice reward for investors who bought the dip in September 2017. But the likelihood of Treyvent hitting the pre-specified commercial milestones seems high (given its advantages over market leader Remodulin in the pulmonary arterial hypertension space). Our NPV calculations show that STDY is still a great buy at this elevated price.<br>

        <p>
            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4164623-mammoth-energy-services-buy-dip-recent-blackout-puerto-rico">=> Mammoth Energy Services: Buy The Dip From The Recent Blackout In Puerto Rico</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: Puerto Rican officials were justified in voicing strong criticism over the TUSK subcontractor that caused back-to-back blackouts across the island due to negligent electrical work. But the 15% hit to the market cap seems like an overreaction, given that the subcontractor has already been fired, and prior to the dip, TUSK's stock price had been on a tear, driven largely from their quality work rebuilding Puerto Rico's electrical grid, which had garnered them several contract extensions.
