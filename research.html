                    <p>INVESTMENT THESIS: After years of testing, new Grid products Resilient Electric Grid (“REG”) and Ship Protection System (“SPS”) are ready to move decisively from the R&D phase to the commercial phase. Initial orders from an electric utility and the US Navy validate the sizable opportunity of each respective market. The balance sheet is adequate, and the current liquidity position should be enough to get AMSC to profitability as REG and SPS sales ramp up. We think AMSC is a Strong Buy.</p>

However, they have another potential blockbuster candidate, vadadustat, which is in several phase-3 trials around the globe. The hope is that it can become the standard of care in the $6B+ market for anemia due to CKD in adults with DD-CKD and NDD-CKD. Our valuation for vadadustat alone justifies a position in AKBA.</p>

NDAs for lead candidate Plinabulin in both the US and China are set to be submitted during 2020, meaning that commercialization is right around the corner. An improved safety profile demonstrated thus far indicate that Plinabulin should be able to differentiate itself in a crowded CIN field. Additionally, its anti-cancer properties could potentially position it to be a part of not just NSCLC combo therapies, but across various tumor types. We think BYSI is a Buy.</p>

Based on the results for 1H19 and management’s 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance, we should see about $42M of FCFE for 2019. With a diluted market cap of $262M, this gives a forward P/FCFE multiple of 6.3x. While two of their digital offerings (Townsquare Interactive and Townsquare Ignite) could see substantial revenue growth and each reach annual revenues of $100M in the next 3-5 years, we think the current operational results, along with the 4.2% dividend yield, make this a strong buy right now.</p>

The commercial success of ALXN’s Soliris, which had $3.6B in global sales in 2018, validates the opportunity for narsoplimab given that they target indications of similar patient sizes. Liquidity may become an issue after October 1, 2020, when pass-through status for Omidria is set to expire. Until then, however, we feel confident that Omidria will continue to bring in $100M+/yr in sales, which will fund the development of narsoplimab and the expected launch (pending approval) in 2020.</p>

A Bank) are battling two very disruptive trends in men’s fashion: the growing acceptance of more casual dress in the office setting, and the growing popularity of custom suits. Management is aware that their traditional business model, which consisted of large stockpiles of off-the-rack suits, is losing ground. While it’s too early to tell if the changes they are making can stabilize or reverse the negative trend in comps, the severe punishment the stock has received this year seems to already price in a dividend cut (or elimination). Further downside seems unlikely given the already low forward P/E of under 6x, and any improvement in the top-line in the coming quarters could offer a nice boost to the stock price.</p>

                    <p>INVESTMENT THESIS: MDR’s 1Q19 results saw no new changes in cost estimates for legacy CBI projects. In addition, the backlog continues to grow nicely, and the $475M in annual savings from the merger synergies have all been actioned and will be fully realized in 2020. However, this good news was overshadowed by an increase in cash usage for 2019 due to higher integration, restructuring, and divestiture costs, delayed initiation of LNG production at the Cameron facility, and delayed receipt of an advanced payment for an expected mega-project award. The long-term upside remains unchanged, and this is a buying opportunity.</p>

                    <p>INVESTMENT THESIS: Commercialized drug Auryxia (approved in the US for hyperphosphatemia in adults with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in adults with non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD) has blockbuster potential, but after several years on the market, annual sales are only about $100M. However, they have another potential blockbuster candidate, vadadustat, which is in several phase-3 trials around the globe. The hope is that it can become the standard of care in the $6B+ market for anemia due to CKD in adults with DD-CKD and NDD-CKD. Our valuation for vadadustat alone justifies a position in AKBA.</p>
