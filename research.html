            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4254027-puma-biotechnology-investors-like-eu-africa-partnership-terms-risk-reward-attractive">=> Puma Biotechnology: Investors Didn't Like The EU/Africa Partnership Terms, But The Risk/Reward Is Attractive.
            </a><br>

            Investment Thesis: PBYI dropped about 8% on the EU/Africa Nerlynx licensing deal news, likely because investors wanted an immediate buyout. But the risk/reward profile is favorable, given that the current stock price is fully supported from reasonable Nerlynx sales estimates in the US and EU for the currently approved indication alone (HER2+ post-Herceptin breast cancer). Any realized milestones (up to $345M from the EU/Africa deal) or expanded approvals in other variants of breast cancer would unlock even more value.

            </a><br>

            Investment Thesis: The poor comps guidance for 1QFY19 caused another sharp drop (this time over 25%). But we still see healthy cash flow, a favorable forward P/E, and a safe 9% dividend even if comps at Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank stay at -4% for the entire year. This retailer is not “dying” and has been overly punished.

            </a><br>

            Investment Thesis: TSQ is a very underfollowed stock that exhibits a lot of volatility. But the core marketing solutions segment has been largely responsible for generating $40M+ of cash the past two years, and guidance indicates that 2019 will be no different. With a market cap of only $104M and a 5% dividend, this is a great buying opportunity.

            </a><br>

            Investment Thesis: CHK’s 4Q18 results showed demonstrable progress on the two main transformation drivers: increased oil production (as a percentage of total production volume) and increasing adjusted EBITDA (per boe). They will still be FCF negative for 2019, but the market’s reaction indicates that it sees very solid earnings in 2020 and beyond.

        <p>

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4237533-firsthand-technology-value-fund-quasi-arbitrage-opportunity">=> Firsthand Technology Value Fund: A Quasi-Arbitrage Opportunity</a><br>

            Investment Thesis: SVVC is a publicly traded venture capital fund. Just like GSVC, another publicly traded venture capital fund, it has historically traded at a steep discount (50%) to the NAV/share of its combined holdings. Based on some recent IPOs of 3 of its top 5 holdings (one of which has increased in value astronomically), the calculated NAV/share has increased significantly since the last update from management. But the stock now trades at a 70%+ discount to NAV/share, creating a very compelling buying opportunity.

            <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4231528-office-depot-december-sell-unfair">=> Office Depot: The December Sell-Off Was Unfair</a><br>
            Investment Thesis: The December market downturn clipped 30% off the market cap. The last 3 earnings reports have seen guidance either reaffirmed or raised, but the stock has now given back all the previous gains. With bankruptcy off the table, ODP is now focused on integrating CompuCom and continuing its transition into services, aiming to become a one-stop-shop for small and medium-sized businesses to obtain help with marketing, IT, accounting, etc. The safe 4% dividend, $100M share buyback that started January 1, and the low forward PE make this a top pick.

            Investment Thesis: This is a very long-term investment, as the follow-up phase 3 Otividex trial will not read out until 2020. But the cash situation remains excellent, and the commercial prospects remain unchanged. The drift down from $6/share at the beginning of 2018 presents an excellent entry and accumulation point.

            Investment Thesis: IRIX offers much less risk than what is usually found among stocks of such small market cap size. Prior to the drop from the recent public offering (which derisked the balance sheet), two consecutive earnings reports showed very strong growth from their Cyclo G6 laser platform, making it clear that they are on their way to disrupting the global glaucoma treatment market.

            Investment Thesis: The market was clearly not happy with the court settlement, given that after more than five years of litigation, AMSC was only able to recoup $58M in damages, even though losses in annual revenue stemming from IP theft at the hands of Chinese wind giant Sinovel totaled more than $500M. However, while news regarding the wind segment is pushing down the stock price, the company's other operating segment is set to begin commercialization of a technology that could revamp the electric grid nationwide, allowing neighborhoods that lose power from a storm or terrorist attack to regain it much faster than legacy technology allows.<br>

            Investment Thesis: The commercial prospects of KERX’s lead drug Auryxia and AKBA’s lead candidate Vadadustat remain unchanged post-merger announcement. At a minimum, the value of the combined company should be equal to the value of each company separately, given the expected $250M in synergies. The downward market reaction seems unjustified, and offers a good entry point.<br>

            Investment Thesis: The recently announced merger with UTHR was a nice reward for investors who bought the dip in September 2017. But the likelihood of Treyvent hitting the pre-specified commercial milestones seems high (given its advantages over market leader Remodulin in the pulmonary arterial hypertension space). Our NPV calculations show that STDY is still a great buy at this elevated price.<br>

            Investment Thesis: Puerto Rican officials were justified in voicing strong criticism over the TUSK subcontractor that caused back-to-back blackouts across the island due to negligent electrical work. But the 15% hit to the market cap seems like an overreaction, given that the subcontractor has already been fired, and prior to the dip, TUSK's stock price had been on a tear, driven largely from their quality work rebuilding Puerto Rico's electrical grid, which had garnered them several contract extensions.
