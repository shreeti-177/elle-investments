    <p>Thank you for visiting our Research page. Below is a list of research we have published on certain companies that we follow. We welcome your feedback. Additionally, we are thinking of launching a subscription service that would offer early access to our research, along with some other features that investors might find useful (i.e. general portfolio management strategies, live blog updates highlighting our reaction to breaking news, etc.). If you would be interested in subscribing to such a service, please let us know.

                        given that the current stock price is fully supported from reasonable Nerlynx sales estimates in the US and EU
